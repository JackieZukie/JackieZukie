# Welcome to my profile!!
Hi I'm Jackie (or Mio) and welcome to my profile!
I'm a programmer working on a couple of mods for [Friday Night Funkin'](https://github.com/FunkinCrew/Funkin). I've been making FNF mods for about 4 years now, it's actually the whole reason I learned how to code. I am entirely self taught, everything I've learned about programming was from studying code here on github, or youtube tutorials.
